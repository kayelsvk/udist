UNICORN DISTRIBUTION by kayelsvk

In development since 27 Jan 2016

Unicorn Distribution is an OOP-based product manufacture and distribution
simulation thought up and developed by kayelsvk, a young computer science
student from Slovakia. It is primarily meant to be an exercise
in object-oriented programming and software design, and (in its later stages)
as a tool to provide interesting (and perhaps useful) simulation data.

The basic design looks like this:
The game/simulation is taking place in a 2D grid-world. There are various
organizations that interact with each other and with materials/products. So far,
the only available type of an organization is a factory, which produces
a certain type of a product from raw materials and/or other products. Later on,
there will be other types of organizations available, such as mines (providing
raw materials) or shopping centres (providing the final outlet for products).
The simulation runtime is step-based, with each step executing supply ordering,
product manufacture and expedition and other necessary tasks.
